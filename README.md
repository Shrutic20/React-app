I have done some tasks related to Spring Boot. Specifically, I have been writing REST APIs to understand the flow of the code, further expanding my technical skill set. These tasks have been both challenging and rewarding, as they allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios.
I would like to highlight my dedication to learning and professional growth during the past year. I actively engaged in a series of interactive training sessions that not only broadened my knowledge but also enhanced my practical skills. These training sessions, which included lab exercises, allowed me to gain valuable insights and expertise that I have successfully applied in my recent assignments.

Furthermore, I enthusiastically participated in a company hackathon, where I had the opportunity to work on the UI part using React. This experience was not only intellectually stimulating but also a testament to my commitment to applying my skills in a practical context.

I am excited about my current project that is Manual Re-age assignment. I will be working with React, and I am eager to leverage the knowledge and skills I have gained to contribute effectively to the project.


Continuously worked on improving interpersonal skills and fostering effective communication and collaboration.
Successfully completed all mandatory trainings ahead of time.
